# A collection of containers

This repo is intended as a collection of tools for creating
semi-reproducible development environment on non-nix systems

## Stack needed

  - Podman
  - Docker (possibly rootless) [note that can be avoided using podman with some thinkering]
  - Devcontainers/CLI (it needs Node.js)
